    a web application called tracare, a wellness tracker and digital journal. having done bullet journaling in the past, i thought this would be a useful application 
    that is slightly more convenient than designing and logging into a physical journal. i created this on cs50's codespace using html/css and javascript for the front-end and python and flask for the back-end. i also used sql to store user data.

    during the semester, i spent the first few weeks working on the front-end. most of this front-end work was redoing the color scheme of the portal to meet wcag. i ended up making the main colors to be shades of purple instead of shades of pink as it maintained our feminine aesthetic while being much more readable against white text. 
    after getting more comfortable with the front-end, i began working on the back-end, making edits such as adding resources, creating new tabs, editing search capabilities, and revamping profile editing.">
